1943 - 6 June 2007

Birmingham, Alabama, USA

An avid Myst fan, she was mostly a solitary player and not a forum poster, but one of her favorite times in the cavern was when a group of explorers helped her and her son, J'Ankenne to open the doors in Delin and Tsogahl. A ceramic artist who created sculptures based on the sea, she loved the beauty of the Myst games, and the creativity that she saw displayed in the Myst community.

5 December 1953 - 28 December 2004

Arkansas, USA

Known on the forums and by her friends as Pepsi and using the name "Pehpsee" in the cavern (Ubisoft's policy prohibited avatar names with copyrighted products in them), Janet was active in the community by 2003. Joining the Ubisoft forums as Pepsi1953 in June of that year, she would become a Moderator and Community Assistant on the Ubisoft MystWorlds forums. Later that year, she would participate in the Uru Live Beta (Choru) and join the Guild of Greeters. She also participated in Prologue and was one of the original members of the D'ni League of Activities. Pepsi received many well wishes in her last days and many tributes upon her passing, including one from Cyanist Richard Watson (RAWA) written in the D'ni language, thus earning her entrance into the D'ni Dictionary as a reference for those phrases.
