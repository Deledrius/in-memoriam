OOC NOTE: This is not for the in-game character, but for the real-life person who was the inspiration for Uru's Jeff Zandi.

A friend of the Miller brothers and the inspiration for the Uru character of the same name, Jeff Zandi was well-known in the Texas Magic: The Gathering community for forming the Texas Guildmages, which has run for over two decades. He was a part of every meeting up until his death.

He also helped found the Hunter Burton Memorial Open, a regular Magic: The Gathering charity event to promote awareness about suicide prevention within the gaming community, named after a young man from the MTG community who tragically took his own life in July 2013.

Jeff is survived by his wife Willa and son Lawson.

5 September 1954 - 24 May 2014

Planet Pluto (Federal Way, WA.)

Zardoz's roots in the Myst/Uru Community can be traced back to at least Spring 2001 when he pursued the mystery of the realMyst Easter Eggs, documenting it thoroughly on his website, Zardoz's realMyst Easter Egg Hunt and other Goodies, and a year later, documenting Zandi's mysterious clues with the pages Zandi Facts. He participated in the Uru Live Beta (Choru), Prologue (opening the Bahro door in Eder Kemo to let Phil Henderson out), D'mala, Myst Online: Uru Live (GameTap era) and MOULagain. Although he was "not much of a social explorer" in the cavern, Zardoz was very active in the community through CyanChat and forums, gave a "realMyst flymode" presentation at Mysterium 2003, assisted with the DRC Liaisons election near the end of D'mala, answered Myst/Uru related questions on the forums, and offered advice on many other topics. His sense of humor is revealed in the February 2007 D'ni Network Pen and Ink Interview with Zardoz, his creativity can be seen in the OpenUru Writers Club: The Fall of a Sparrow: A Zardoz Project, and both are evident in the brief storyline he conducted in the summer of 2007. Zardoz backed Cyan's Obduction Kickstarter in October 2013 and was generally active in the community until a few months before his death.
