Also known on some forums as RSHayter or RonHayter, Ron was best known in the community for development of the programs, Riveal and Revelator which allowed users to extract sounds, movies and textures from Myst games. While the programs were appreciated by many fans, their legality was sometimes questioned, but a post by Chogon put those concerns to rest. Ron was a long time Myst fan and attended Mysterium 2003 in Spokane.

February 2012

Las Vegas, Nevada, USA

SIL_OH_WET on the forums, sil_oh_wet in the cavern, and just "Sil" to her friends, Lisa was an active explorer during the early Myst Online: Uru Live (GameTap era) days, participating in many storylines, hosting dance parties in the Kahlo Pub and hosting events in her neighborhood. "sil_oh_wet’s Bevin" was a popular place in those days, used to summon Yeesha (and she actually appeared), a gathering place to wait for news from Rils when he went on an expedition to Negilahn with Douglas Sharper, and of course for parties, including the weekly Karaoke. Karaoke nights were Sil's idea and she organized and hosted them for several months before sharing the duties with other D'niJs. When the cavern closed in April 2008, the event continued in Second Life and continues to this day, both in SL and in the cavern.

Terri was, with JWPlatt and Jamey, one of the co-founders of OpenUru.org.

"You were always a constant source of inspiration, kindness, and fun in the cavern. A perfect example of this community at its best. This Age of Veelay Tsahvahn is for you.

Be well, Tai...wherever you are. You will be missed always."
